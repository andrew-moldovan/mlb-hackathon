# MLB Hackathon
MLB Hackathon project

##Seed
I used the [gulp angular yo generator](https://github.com/Swiip/generator-gulp-angular) to get started.

##Setup
##### Install required tools `gulp` and `bower`:
```
npm install -g gulp bower
```
##### Clone this repo
##### Run the `bower` and `npm` installs
```
npm install
bower install
```
##### To start the application
```
gulp serve
```
##### Then navigate to `localhost:3000`


##Why typescript
I chose to use typescript for a number of reasons, first and foremost that angular 2.0 is being written in typescript and looking at a lot of what has come out of the latest ng-conf conferences, a lot of people are using typescript to write their angular apps to ease migration. The syntax is very similar (it's just a superset of javascript), and offers a few syntactic goodies (types, lambda syntax for functions, etc...) that may be used if it helps.
